We understand the importance of learning through play and all the benefits it provides for early childhood development therefore, we believe we can instill a love for learning, while having fun exploring the world around us.</p>
                <p className='mx-auto pt-4 w-4/5 text-xl font-light leading-normal'>Experiences have taught me that education looks different for every child. Their mind is constantly being molded through experiences, and it all starts with the first years of early childhood. Our mission is to provide quality care, respect, kindness, and support that children deserve so they can ask more questions, feed their curiosity of the world and aquire critical thinking for themselves to learn how to analyze their surroundings and draw their own conclusions. We will support each child paving their path towards success as we contribute to their foundation.</p>

Our practices here at Learning Time Adventure not only hope to inspire our youth to be all they can be as a kind hearted well rounded individual, but also spark a change in how providers service all children in their care.</p>
                <p className='mx-auto pt-4 w-4/5 text-xl font-light leading-normal italic'>We're one of the few that is in this to make a difference. In a world where everything is constantly changing we are here to provide stability for the child and families we serve.”</p>
